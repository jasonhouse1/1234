Please read the following carefully:<br>1. The Social SUPER MANager platform utilizes the third-party service NewebPay for credit card online payments. By binding payment information on this platform, users agree to use this third-party service and consent to automatic monthly deductions according to these terms.<br>2. The platform charges users monthly; service fees for the current month will be deducted on the billing date and are non-refundable.<br>3. Project owners may remove their bound payment method at any time and bind a new payment method before the next billing date to ensure continuous operation of the chatbot/analytic management tools.<br>4. The time zone used for billing is UTC +0.<br>5. The holder of the Social SUPER MANager account should use their own credit card to bind payment for service fees. If the account holder uses another individual's credit card (hereinafter referred to as the \"actual payer\"), the Company will deem that the account holder has obtained legal authorization and the actual payer fully acknowledges this payment. Both the account holder and the actual payer have the right to inquire about user account information related to the payment, terminate payments, or make personal information changes specific to the actual payer.<br>6. The Company shall not be liable for compensation in case the platform ceases operation due to force majeure (e.g., natural disasters), interruptions, delays, or communication defects from cloud hosting providers, hardware vendors, third-party service providers, or messaging platforms connected to the chatbot (e.g., Facebook, LINE), or damages caused by other users. The estimated repair time and related messages will be announced on the official fan page or website.<br>7. Users can view and download receipts from their personal billing page upon each successful payment.<br>8. If users upgrade to a paid plan and wish to revert to the free plan after payment, they can make this change on the \"About Me\" page. Changes will take effect on the next billing date, and no refunds will be issued.<br>9. Stopping Payments:<br>a. If users no longer wish to continue payment, they can downgrade to the free plan or remove their payment information on the \"About Me\" page.<br>b. If users remove their payment information from the platform and payment cannot be processed on the next billing date, the plan will automatically downgrade to the free plan, resulting in partial or full loss of functionality.<br>The Company grants users the right to use the provided services. If specific conditions regarding usage fees, duration, or other terms apply, users must adhere to such conditions. Users who have agreed to these terms are not entitled to request termination of service or refund under any circumstances. Even if the service interface displays terms such as \"purchase\" or \"sell,\" the related intellectual property rights or other rights provided by business partners or users are not transferred to the users; only usage rights are granted."
